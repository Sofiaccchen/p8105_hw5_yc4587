  # Generate n random birthdays

1. Power vs. Effect Size (First Plot):
   - The plot shows that power increases with 𝜇. For example, at 𝜇= 1, power is approximately 0.15, meaning the null hypothesis is only rejected around 15% of the time, indicating low sensitivity for small effects.
   - As 𝜇 increases, power rises significantly. At 𝜇 = 3, power reaches approximately 0.75, indicating a 75% chance of detecting the effect.
   - By 𝜇 = 4, power is around 0.95, and for 𝜇≥ 5, power approaches 1. This suggests that for larger effects 𝜇≥ 4, the test is highly effective at rejecting the null hypothesis, achieving nearly 100% sensitivity.
   
2. For the second plot
No, the sample average of ^μ across tests for which the null is rejected is not approximately equal to the true value of μ, especially at lower μ values. This is because of selection bias: only samples with larger-than-average estimates are likely to lead to rejection when μ is small, inflating the average ^μ in the subset where the null is rejected. As μ increases, this bias reduces because the power is higher, allowing even typical estimates to result in rejection, bringing the average ^μ closer to the true μ.

Problem 3 
```{r}
homicide_data = read_csv("homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    solved = disposition != "Closed without arrest" & 
             disposition != "Open/No arrest"
  )

# Summarize by city
city_summary = homicide_data %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(
    total = n(),
    unsolved = sum(!solved)
  )

# Function to run prop.test and tidy results
run_prop_test = function(total, unsolved) {
  prop.test(unsolved, total) %>%
    broom::tidy() %>%
    select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
}

# Calculate proportions and CIs for all cities
city_props = city_summary %>%
  mutate(
    prop_test = map2(total, unsolved, run_prop_test)
  ) %>%
  unnest(prop_test) %>%
  arrange(desc(estimate))

# Create plot of unsolved homicide proportions
ggplot(city_props, aes(y = reorder(city_state, estimate), x = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high)) +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of Unsolved Homicides by City",
    x = "Proportion Unsolved",
    y = "City"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))

The raw homicide dataset contains 52,179 records and 12 columns, detailing individual homicide cases across 50 U.S. cities. Key columns include `uid`, a unique identifier for each case; `reported_date`, indicating the date the homicide was reported in YYYYMMDD format; and victim details, such as `victim_last` (last name), `victim_first` (first name), `victim_race`, `victim_age`, and `victim_sex`. Location information includes `city`, `state`, and geographic coordinates (`lat` and `lon`). The `disposition` column specifies the case outcome, with entries like "Closed without arrest" or "Closed by arrest." Overall, this dataset provides a comprehensive overview of homicides, allowing for analysis of factors such as victim demographics, case dispositions, and geographic distribution.
